    "# Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. So far, all the programs we have written work by executing each statement in the program in order, from top to bottom. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. To write programs that solve more complex problems, we need mechanisms that will allow statements to be executed in more complex ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. For example, we might like to execute some statements under some conditions but not others, or we might like to execute some statements multiple times. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Behold- conditional statements!\n",
    "\n",
    "5. We can use conditional statements to change the behavior of a program based on whether specific conditions are or are not met.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. To put this another way, conditional statements check boolean expressions (i.e. conditions), and change the behavior of the program accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operator Review\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Operators used to compare two objects:\n",
    "- `==`    equal to\n",
    "- `==`    equal to\n",
    "- `!=`    not equal to\n",
    "- `>=`    greater than or equal to\n",
    "- `>`     greater than\n",
    "- `<`     less than\n",
    "- `<=`    less than or equal to\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Boolean logical operators:\n",
    "- `and`   both must be true\n",
    "- `or`    one or both must be true\n",
    "- `not`   reverses the truth value\n",
    "\n",
    "9. We can use and test for conditions in a few key ways, specifically through `if` statements and `loops`.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. More on loops later, but for now...\n",
    "\n",
    "## `if` Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Python's comparison operators serve as conditional tests that return a True or False."
